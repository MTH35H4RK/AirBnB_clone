## Description :page_facing_up:
This marks the initial stage of a four-phase endeavor aimed at crafting a fundamental replica of the AirBnB online platform. During this primary phase, we established a rudimentary console utilizing the Cmd Python module. This console serves as a comprehensive tool for overseeing the project's objects, allowing us to seamlessly execute functions like create, show, update, all, and destroy across the existing classes and their subclasses.

## Built with :gear:
python3 (3.4.3)
